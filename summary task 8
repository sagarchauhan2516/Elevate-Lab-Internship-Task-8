Task 8 :Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

1. VPN Setup Steps:

   1.  Chosen VPN Service: ProtonVPN Free Tier
   2.  Account Creation: Signed up for a free account on website
   3.  Client Installation: Downloaded the .deb package for Kali Linux from the official website and installed it using `sudo dpkg -i` and `sudo apt install -f` for dependencies.
   4.  Connection: Launched the VPN client, logged in, and connected to the Netherland server.

2. Verification and Observation:

   * Original IP: 2409:40c1:2012:fd4e:8tf0:cbs0:70d0:335
   * VPN IP: 2a00:7c80:0:3bb::14
   * Location Change: Successfully verified that my apparent location changed from India to Netherland.
   * Browse Speed: Noted a slight decrease in Browse speed while connected to the VPN.

3. Research on VPN Encryption and Privacy Features:

   * Encryption: VPNs use strong encryption protocols (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPsec) and encryption standards like AES-256. This means all data traveling between the user's device and the VPN server is scrambled, making it unreadable to ISPs, governments, or malicious actors intercepting the traffic.
   * "No-Logs" Policy: A reputable VPN with a strict "no-logs" policy ensures that the provider does not record user activity, IP addresses, connection timestamps, or bandwidth usage. This is crucial for privacy, as it means there's no data to hand over even if requested by authorities.
   * Kill Switch: A Kill Switch automatically blocks all internet traffic if the VPN connection unexpectedly drops. This prevents accidental exposure of the user's real IP address and unencrypted data.
   * DNS Leak Protection: This feature ensures that DNS (Domain Name System) queries, which translate domain names into IP addresses, are also routed through the encrypted VPN tunnel, preventing third parties (like ISPs) from seeing which websites a user is visiting.
   * Server Locations: The number and distribution of server locations impact connection speed (closer servers are generally faster) and the ability to access geo-restricted content.

6. Summary of VPN Benefits and Limitations:

   * Benefits:
        * Enhanced Privacy: Hides your real IP address and encrypts your internet traffic, preventing ISPs, governments, and other third parties from monitoring your online activities.
        * Secure Communication: Protects your data when using public Wi-Fi networks, making it harder for attackers to snoop on your information.
        * Bypassing Geo-restrictions: Allows access to content and services that might be unavailable in your geographical region by routing traffic through servers in different countries.
        * Anonymity (Partial): While not completely anonymous, it adds a significant layer of obfuscation to your online presence.
        * Censorship Circumvention: Can help bypass internet censorship in restrictive regions.

   * Limitations:
        * Speed Reduction: Encryption and routing traffic through an extra server can lead to a decrease in internet speed.
        * Trust in Provider: You are entrusting your data to the VPN provider. Their "no-logs" policy and security practices are critical.
        * Cost: While free tiers exist, full-featured VPN services typically require a paid subscription. Free VPNs often have data caps, speed limits, or fewer server options.
        * Not a Magic Bullet: A VPN protects your network traffic but does not protect against malware, phishing attacks, or unsafe Browse habits. It also doesn't anonymize you if you log into accounts that identify you.
        * Legality: The legality of VPNs varies by country; in some regions, their use is restricted or illegal.

5. Conclusion:

   VPNs are powerful tools for enhancing online privacy and security by encrypting traffic and masking IP addresses. While they offer significant benefits, it's essential to understand their limitations and choose a reputable provider. This exercise successfully demonstrated the setup and verification of a VPN connection.
